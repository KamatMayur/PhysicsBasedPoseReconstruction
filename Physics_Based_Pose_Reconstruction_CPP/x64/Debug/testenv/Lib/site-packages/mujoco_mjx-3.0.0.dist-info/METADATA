# MuJoCo XLA (MJX)

[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/mujoco-mjx/

This package is a re-implementation of the
[MuJoCo physics engine](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco) in
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). This library is developed and maintained
by Google DeepMind, and is kept up-to-date with the latest developments in
MuJoCo itself.

The `mujoco-mjx` package is API-compatible with MuJoCo, but is missing some
features found in MuJoCo.  See our
[documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html) for more
details concerning feature parity.

## Installation

The recommended way to install this package is via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mujoco-mjx/):

```sh
pip install mujoco-mjx
```

## Usage

Once installed, the package can be imported via `from mujoco import mjx`. Please
consult our [documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html)
for further detail on the package's API.

We recommend going through the tutorial notebook which covers the basics of
MuJoCo using Python:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/mjx/tutorial.ipynb)

## Versioning

The `major.minor.micro` portion of the version number matches the version of
MuJoCo that this library provides. Optionally, if we release updates to MJX that
target the same version of MuJoCo, a `.postN` suffix is added, for example
`3.0.1.post2` represents the second update to MJX for MuJoCo 3.0.1.
